                <h3>Toronto Public Library Breach</h3>
                <h4>A Public Sector Institution in Danger 2024-04-03</h4>
                <p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cybersecurity breach experienced by the Toronto Public Library (TPL) serves as a stark reminder of the devastating impact ransomware threats can inflict upon public sector institutions. Having grown up in Rexdale, one of Toronto's low-income suburbs, I have witnessed firsthand the indispensable role our public sector plays in our community's well-being. Given that my neighborhood has historically served as a refuge for asylum seekers and immigrants, the services provided by the public library have been integral to our community's vitality. Countless individuals in my upbringing relied on these services for educational resources, employment opportunities, recreational pursuits, and essential access to Wi-Fi connectivity.
		<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incident, which occurred on October 28, 2023, resulted in the disruption of systems and technologies across over 100 library branches, exposing sensitive employee information, including names, social insurance numbers, and addresses dating back to 1998 (CBC, Jabakshanji). Through conversations with a librarian at the North York Central Library, I gained insights into the profound impact of this breach. In the aftermath, manual book checkouts became necessary, while computer access and printing capabilities were unavailable for months, only recently being reinstated. Services crucial to Toronto's low-income areas, such as map passes and Wi-Fi access, remained offline for extended periods, although efforts were made to expedite their restoration in these vulnerable communities.
		<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my community of Rexdale, firsthand testimonials revealed the disruption caused by the breach, including delays in job assignments affecting delivery drivers, who were instructed to suspend book deliveries until the situation was mitigated (Star, Lachhance). Residents, like Latisha Bailey, eloquently articulated the library's significance, stating, "...the library represented freedom; literally everything we provide is a service" (ibid). This breach underscores the critical importance of cybersecurity and the susceptibility of our most vulnerable populations to malicious attacks, as publicly funded organizations become targets instead of larger entities.
		<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, I fervently hope that the Toronto Public Library can swiftly resolve this situation and implement robust mitigation strategies for the future. Administrative measures, including the prudent management of employee data, regular staff training, and the formulation of comprehensive cybersecurity policies, are imperative. Furthermore, technical safeguards such as routine backups, thorough review of network ports and protocols, network segmentation, and enhanced endpoint security measures are essential (SecurityScoreCard). Once this issue is addressed, I remain optimistic that the Toronto Public Library will continue to serve as a cornerstone of support and enrichment for the diverse communities within the City of Toronto.

            <h3>Covid-19 Breaches in Canada</h3>
            <h4>Hacker's Attacking Our Most Vulnerable 2024-04-03</h4>
            <p><font size="4">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian healthcare system has always been a bastion of national pride. The roots of our healthcare system can be traced back to the former premier of Saskatchewan, Tommy Douglas, often identified as the founder of Canada’s "universal" healthcare (Calgary Herald). His pioneering efforts in establishing the first single-payer universal healthcare program in 1961 laid the groundwork for our current Canadian healthcare system (ibid). The purpose was to establish healthcare as a fundamental right for all Canadians. This renders the ransomware attacks on our healthcare system particularly devastating. It is not merely any public sector institution at stake but one committed to aiding the most vulnerable segments of our society.
	    <br><br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having recently undergone shoulder surgery, I have personally witnessed how hospitals have embraced technology to streamline their services. From the ability to video call with doctors and book appointments online to accessing past medical histories with a simple click of an app like MyChart, the Ontario healthcare system has not only become more transparent but also more user-friendly.
	    <br><br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, with these innovations came an increased emphasis on cybersecurity. However, this did not prevent 39 Canadian [public] organizations from experiencing data leaks in 2019 (Global, Gilmore). While services like the MyChart application have significantly improved the Ontario Provincial healthcare system, they also expose us to vulnerabilities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was forecasted that a ransomware attack could impede hospitals from attending to patients, alter surgery schedules, and compromise Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (Global, Gilmore). Despite the escalating frequency of public sector attacks globally, Evan Koronewski of the Communication Security Establishment (CSE) has affirmed that "we acknowledge these threats, and both the CSE and the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security are tirelessly working to mitigate them" (ibid).
	    <br><br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reassuring to witness government agencies such as the CSE actively engaged in safeguarding our most vulnerable citizens in the public sector. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that ransomware attacks on government bodies have been associated with demands averaging between 15 to 30 billion dollars as of 2019-2020 (Global, Gilmore). The fulfillment of such demands could prove detrimental not only to a province but arguably to the entire nation, given that our healthcare system is funded by taxpayers' dollars.
Instead of targeting large corporations, cybercriminals are increasingly focusing on institutions that are instrumental in saving lives. I remain hopeful that the CSE and other Canadian government bodies will continue to recognize the critical importance of cybersecurity. By doing so, we can protect our most vulnerable populations and uphold the essential services that contribute to the greatness of our nation.
